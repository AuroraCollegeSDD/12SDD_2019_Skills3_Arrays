INSTRUCTIONs

DO NOT EDIT THE MAIN SCRIPT

The mods.py script consists of python sub-routine stubs for all of the standard algorithms and the searching and sorting algorithms listed in the Course Specifications.

the mods_pseudo.txt script consists of pseudo-code sub-routine stubs for all of the standard algorithms and the searching and sorting algorithms listed in the Course Specifications.

The main.py script is designed to execute all of these sub-routines

You task is to write:
  - pseudocode
  - python code
for each of these algorithms using the Course Specifications as a guide.

The docstring at the begining of each subroutine gives detailed instructions as to what is required. Make sure you read the docstring carefully and understand it.

Several of the docstring descriptions have a Challenge element which you can try if you feel motivated.
